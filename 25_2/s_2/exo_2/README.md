# Sorting Algorithms Benchmark

This project demonstrates and compares the performance of several
classic sorting algorithms implemented in Python.\
Each algorithm is tested on both small and large datasets, and the
execution time is measured for comparison.

## Implemented Algorithms

-   Selection Sort\
-   Quick Sort (Random Pivot)\
-   Quick Sort (Median Pivot)\
-   Merge Sort\
-   Heap Sort

## Usage

Run the script directly to see benchmark results:

``` bash
python sort_benchmark.py
```

The output will display the runtime (in seconds) for each algorithm on
small and large datasets.
